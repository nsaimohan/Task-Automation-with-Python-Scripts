Welcome to my Task Automation Using Python Scripts project! This project was completed during my internship at codeAlpha as a Python Developer Intern.

## Project Overview

Task Automation Using Python Scripts demonstrates the power of Python in automating repetitive tasks, streamlining workflows, and enhancing productivity. By leveraging Python and VS Code, I created a collection of scripts to automate various tasks such as file organization, data cleaning, and system maintenance. These scripts offer efficient solutions to common challenges faced in software development and data management.

## Tools Used

- Python
- VS Code

## Features

- Automated file organization to streamline file management.
- Data cleaning scripts to process and manipulate data efficiently.
- System maintenance scripts for automating routine system tasks.
- Seamless integration with VS Code for a smooth development experience.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-automation-python-scripts.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd task-automation-python-scripts
   ```

3. Run individual scripts as needed to automate specific tasks.
